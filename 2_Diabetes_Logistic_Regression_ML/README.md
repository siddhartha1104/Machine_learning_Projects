## Project Overview

Our project focuses on leveraging the power of machine learning to predict the onset of diabetes based on a dataset containing various health-related features. We have employed two key machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), to create predictive models.

The project is implemented in Python, and we have utilized several essential libraries, including Pyforest, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, for data preprocessing, visualization, model development, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains health-related information, including diagnostic measurements and patient attributes. 

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [GitHub URL]
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages (cmd commands):

   ```bash
   pip install Pyforest
   pip install Seaborn
   ```
2.1. Install the required Python packages (On Jupyter Notebook):

   ```bash
   !pip install Pyforest
   !pip install Seaborn
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook files to explore the project and models.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions and collaborations. If you have ideas for improvement, bug fixes, or new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's work together to enhance the project and make a positive impact on healthcare.
