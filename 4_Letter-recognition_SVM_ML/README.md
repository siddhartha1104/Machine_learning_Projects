- Welcome to the Alphabetic Recognition project, where the power of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), specifically Support Vector Classification (SVC), has been harnessed to accurately classify letters. ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

The goal of this project is to use SVM algorithms to perform classification on letters, ensuring precise recognition through innovative machine learning techniques. With the utilization of SVC, the project aims to classify letters effectively, providing a deeper understanding of the classification process.

## Methodology

### Algorithms Used
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
  - Support Vector Classification (SVC)

### Tools and Libraries

This project makes use of several powerful tools and libraries:

- **Pandas** for efficient data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for creating insightful visualizations
- **Seaborn** for generating heatmaps and advanced data visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** for implementing SVC and generating precise confusion matrices
